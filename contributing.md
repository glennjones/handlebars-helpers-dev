# Welcome!

We're super excited that you're thinking about contributing to this open source project! If you're not quite sure what to do, please feel comfortable asking one of us â€” or just go ahead and submit the issue or pull request anyway. Worst case we might ask you to tweak something. All friendly contributions are welcome!

**What does "contributing" mean?**

Creating an issue is the simplest form of contributing to a project. But there are many ways to contribute, including the following:

- Updating or correcting documentation
- Feature requests
- Bug reports

## Issues

**Before creating an issue**

Please make sure you're creating one in the right place:

- do you have a template syntax question? Like how to accomplish something with handlebars? The best place to get answers for this is [stackoverflow.com][], the [handlebars docs](handlebarsjs.com), or the documentation for the template engine you're using.
- Are you having an issue with a handlebars-helper feature that is powered by an underlying lib? This is sometimes difficult to know, but sometimes it can be pretty easy to find out. If possible, try to see if there is a library responsible for the helper, then create an issue on that library's GitHub repo if it makes sense.

**Creating an issue**

Please be as descriptive as possible when creating an issue. Give us the information we need to successfully answer your question or address your issue by answering the following in your issue:

- what version of handlebars-helpers are you using?
- what helper are you having an issue with?
- please provide a detailed description of the following:
  * example of how you're using the helper
  * the context (data) that your providing the helper (if applicable)
  * is the helper used inside the block of another helper?

Add anything else you think that might help us to get to the root of the problem.

## Above and beyond

Here are some tips for creating idiomatic issues. Taking just a little bit extra time will make your issue easier to read, easier to resolve, more likely to be found by others who have the same or similar issue in the future.

- take some time to learn basic markdown. This [markdown cheatsheet](https://gist.github.com/jonschlinkert/5854601) is super helpful, as is the GitHub guide to [basic markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/).
- Learn about [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/). And if you want to really go above and beyond, read [mastering markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
- use backticks to wrap code. This ensures that code will retain its format, making it much more readable to others
- use syntax highlighting by adding the correct language name after the first "code fence"
